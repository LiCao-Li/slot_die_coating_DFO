# slot_die_coating_DFO
Derivative-Free Optimization approach for coating simulated data

This is the alternative method for slot die coating optmizations by using derivative-free optimization methods.

Approaches:
1. bayesian optimization using boundary conditions
2. customized rewards functions

further improvements:
1. rewards functions needs better design
2. put on remote computer nodes for training 
3. current sample test dosen't show the dynamic improvement, need more diverse samples.
